# Software engineering issues

- common infrastructure for Vellvm and DeepWeb
    - move stuff from DW and Vellvm repos
- should we use Paco?

# Research issues

- should we do up-to tau equivalence?  or something more general?
- generalizing the Event combinators
- using ITrees to support both verification and testing

- Operational Monads
- see the paper references in the README to freer-simple!  (There are a few)
- Haskell stuff
    - e.g., freer-simple (and a few other libraries with the same interface)
    - BUT they don't have to have Tau (so the technicalities are easier)us)
