(** *Weak Bisimulation of CCS

    An attempt to define weak bisimulation of CCS by combining equational laws
    of weak bisimulation and the `eutt` relation intrinsic to ITrees.

    Note that neither heterogeneous bisimulation or weak bisimulation can properly
    capture the weak bisimulation in CCS.

    The weak bisimulation in ITrees capture the coinductive reasoning structure,
    but is unable to handle the bisimulation encoded in the denotational calculi
    that may be modeled by ITrees.
    This is especially tricky because a bisimulation relation is typically
    defined under an operational semantics, where the observed action of a system
    simulates another operationally.

    TODO: 
    One possible direction in extending this is simulation relation is by thinking
    about guarded recursive types.
    See: R.E. Mogelberg, N. Veltri.
         Bisimulation as Path Type for Guarded Recursive Types. [POPL 2018].
