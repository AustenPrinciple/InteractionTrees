# Interaction Trees

## Penn Versions

*  Internal to the DeepWeb development, mostly created by Li-yao.
   - https://github.com/DeepSpec/DeepWeb/blob/master/src/Free/Monad/Free.v 
   - does not use paco
   - supports typeclassses for "event combinators"
   - intended to be compatible with coq-ext-lib?

*  The Vellvm variants
   - https://github.com/vellvm/vellvm/blob/master/src/coq/Trace.v
   - some branches have ported it to use Paco
   - instantiates the monad typeclasses adapted from Iris.  See
     https://github.com/vellvm/vellvm/blob/master/src/coq/Classes.v

*  Newly created repo, intended to unify the two above:
   https://github.com/DeepSpec/InteractionTrees
