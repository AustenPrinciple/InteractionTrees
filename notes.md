# Interaction Trees

## Penn Versions

*  Internal to the DeepWeb development, mostly created by Li-yao.
   - https://github.com/DeepSpec/DeepWeb/blob/master/src/Free/Monad/Free.v 
   - does not use paco
   - supports typeclassses for "event combinators"
   - intended to be compatible with coq-ext-lib?

*  The Vellvm variants
   - https://github.com/vellvm/vellvm/blob/master/src/coq/Trace.v
   - some branches have ported it to use Paco
   - instantiates the monad typeclasses adapted from Iris.  See
     https://github.com/vellvm/vellvm/blob/master/src/coq/Classes.v

*  Newly created repo, intended to unify the two above:
   https://github.com/DeepSpec/InteractionTrees


## Gregory Malecha's variant
   - https://github.com/gmalecha/coq-interaction-trees
   - uses paco
   - more generic?


## MIT Version
   - created by Adam Chlipala and 
   - ?


## Yale Version
   - Vilhelm knows something about it...

# Discussions

- McBride's treatment of effects:  _not_ E : Type -> Type, but rather S and
  S -> Type might be nicer for connecting to trace semantics

- Gregory pointed out that the traces from the DeepWeb development can't
  express effects that "don't return" i.e.
    Exit : E Void

# Challenges
- without paco, run into guardedness problems

- CoInductive proofs about interaction trees that use other lemmas. e.g. use
  transitivity of equivalence in some other lemma
  - e.g. interp distributes over bind: needs associativity / transitivity of
  equiv, but can't use it in Paco
  - potentially addressed by nat-indexing? (see Abishek's)
  - General question: connection of step indexing with coinduction
    (where to read more about this?)

# What would make a good ITrees paper?
- demonstration of programmability + reasoning techniques
- how does it relate to other techniques?
